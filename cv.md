## About me
Throughout my career as a marketing specialist, I have repeatedly faced the challenges related to the IT sphere. Starting from the making of a small landing page to building a layout of own online shop. It was also site advertising and site maintenance, writing small javascript scripts for page layout and minor changes to the existing javascript code.

So, now I decided to gather knowledge together and try myself as a javascript front-end developer. My goal is to get a job in a friendly team and gain experience in this fast-growing world of javascript.
